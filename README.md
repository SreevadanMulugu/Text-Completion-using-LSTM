**Text Completion using LSTM**

This project involves using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), for text completion. In this implementation, data is trained where each alphabet is mapped to numbers and fed into the neural network. The model then predicts numbers that are subsequently converted back into alphabets, thus generating words.

**Advantages Over Word Embeddings**

Using character-level LSTM has certain advantages over traditional word embeddings:

**Finer Detail**: By operating at the character level, the model can capture more nuanced details of the language. It can learn to predict not just words but also the spelling of words letter by letter.
Handling Out-of-Vocabulary Words: Character-level models can generate words that were not present in the training data, which is a significant advantage over word embeddings that typically require a predefined vocabulary.
**Typographical Error Resilience:** Character-level models can manage typographical errors better because they are not reliant on entire words but on the sequence of characters.



**Disadvantages**

However, this approach also has some limitations:

**Longer Sequences**: LSTMs, especially when operating at the character level, struggle to produce longer sequences of text. This is because the dependencies become harder to maintain over long spans of text.
Training Complexity: Training on a character level generally requires more epochs and computational resources due to the finer granularity of the data.
**Context Understanding**: Character-level models might find it more challenging to grasp the broader context compared to word-level models, as they deal with smaller units of data.

**Technical Details**

The implementation specifics are as follows:

**Training Paragraph**: 589 words
**Epochs:** 250
**Batch Size**: 32
